# Chess Game 🎮♟️

This project is a **simple chess game** created for practice and to improve my programming skills.  
It includes the following features:

- 🧠 **AI Opponent** – Play against a basic computer-controlled enemy.  
- 🎬 **Basic Animations** – Smooth piece movements for a better gameplay experience.  
- ♟️ **Classic Chess Rules** – Standard chess mechanics are implemented.  

## Purpose
This game is made purely for **learning and practice purposes**, and not as a full professional chess engine.  
It serves as a way to gain knowledge in game development, AI logic, and simple animations.

## How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Run the game file (depending on your programming language setup).  
3. Play chess against either another player or the AI.  

## Notes
- This project is still in a **basic stage** and may not include advanced chess mechanics or optimizations.  
- Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome!
